## Chapter One

In the fall of 2016, I was living in San Francisco. San Francisco is a fantastic place in autumn. The season starts with what the locals call "Indian Summer" (which is actually a meteorological term, according to the internet), where it is sunny all day and the temperature stays in the high seventies. Then the weather starts to cool down. My walk to the bus turns into a swim through pea soup fog. If London still had fog, I would imagine it being far less dense than this.

It was Saturday and I was walking downhill after getting off of the Muni at West Portal. The fog was impenetrable, but I kept moving on. The beautiful thing about the city, is that if you keep heading downhill, you will get to the ocean. As I walk, I enter a new section of the city, affectionately known as Parkside, is strange. It is full of Chinese and Irish folks. So, all of the breakfast places serve Irish Coffee, corn beef and hash, and steamed pork buns. The ice cream parlor serves hamburgers, ice cream, bobba tea and fried rice. Halloween must have been nearby, because the chef at the Thai restaurant I passed was dressed as a ninja.

I kept walking. Google had recently released their new in-ear headphones, so I was walking to some deep trance. The heavy beats and quiet melodies kept me moving deeper and deeper into the fog and down the hill. The headphones that were essentially tattooed behind my ears quieted the music as a car flew by. I pulled my hood over my head as the fog turned into a wet mist. The music picked back up.

I said hello to a cute guy passing by, my music quieted for a moment again, awaiting incoming conversation, but she just smiled and kept walking up hill. I glanced back, briefly, but saw no turn from him. I put my hands into my jacket pocket and kept moving.

The mist thinned a little, and the hill flattened out. I crossed the street and climbed to the top of the dunes, and I saw the large chunks of junk washing up on the shore. I scrambled up to the top of the cement barricade, sat down on the edge and pulled out my thermos of hot jasmine tea and a box of steamed pork buns. My backpack was something I had designed myself a few years back. Originally I designed it for outdoor concerts. It was a sling over one shoulder and formed a tight loop around your torso. The front had a small pocket, good for a cell phone or music device. The back was wider. It was meant to have room for a jacket, a large water bottle and a box of food. It also had small hidden pockets for stashing things like money or marijuana or condoms. There was also a false bottom for hiding a tall can of beer or two flasks. I ended up selling the design to a local backpack company, and it did not sell as well as I had hoped.

The junk floating up, was from the war. About a year ago, Japan, China, India and Russia's economies all essentially collapsed. Some company in Japan started building these boats that were some, that floated across the Pacific Ocean, each carrying around two hundred people. I think they stole the idea from some Neal Stephenson book, but when the first few arrived on the California coast near Santa Barbra, they were essentially coffins. The United States coast guard originally started turning the boats back, but most of them fell apart on the return journey. People on the other side must have assumed it was working, because two weeks later, three hundred ships were found crossing the Pacific. A month later, ten thousand ships were en-route to California. After several warnings, and the realization that the Chinese government had essentially funded the mass exodus, the President of the United States of America approved putting mines off the coast of California. Now bodies and wreckage are all that arrive on the San Francisco coast. The United Nations believes the United States is guilty of killing approximately ten million refugees.

Obviously, this did not go over well with the American people. Apparently, civil war broke out first in Colorado. I'm somewhat unclear of the specifics, because information has not been flowing quite as well as it used to. But Colorado's neighbors took up arms as well, soon "The Four Corners Union" was born. Soon to follow, "The State of Jefferson", containing about two thirds of California, and all of Oregon and Washington broke off as well. The war wasn't incredibly bloody. The Internet let people essential use flash mobs to take over military bases, and often many uniformed men and women joined to side of the rebellion.

So now, North America has four countries. The United States of America, Canada, The Four Corners Union and The State of Jefferson. Most of the battles seem to be in the capitol and at the United Nations. The biggest problem really, is that The State of Jefferson has adopted a very strict policy of Libertarianism, bordering on anarchy. So, in a city like San Francisco, shit is getting heavy. I started carrying a gun about a week ago, and version two of my backpack is selling like hot cakes (it adds a easy to access holder for a hand gun and specific storage for ammo and a gas mask internally). Initially I was pretty worried about being jumped, but I've found as long as I stay out of the Bart tunnels, the Tenderloin, and off of the Bay Bridge, I don't have to worry about being shot and raped. Rumor has it, Muni will run out of fuel soon, so I'm hoping to move out of the Financial district and into a flat above a coffee shop up near 25th Avenue. I've accepted a job to pay for the rent. Apparently people still drink coffee even though things are going to shit.

One of the bodies on the ocean twitches, and starts to move their arm. A turret to my right springs to life, targets the body, and puts an anti-tank round into the body. Salt water saturated flesh flies up into the air. I put my lunch away, check my gun, and jump down into the city. I walk away from the ocean, trying to remember what it was like playing on beaches as a child; but my mind keeps returning to the wreckage on the beach.

This city is toxic to my memories. I need to get out of here.

## Chapter Two

I was able to sell most of my possessions so I could carry everything in one trip, but I kept two bags of supplies, my laptop, and a semi-automatic rifle I stole from the Air Force base. I move into my new loft. It contains a couch, a TV and a bed. It even has a small fridge and hot plate. The bathroom worked, although there was no hot water. I did a little reading before falling asleep on the couch.

I awoke quickly to the sound of a bell. It took me a few seconds to grab my bearings as I glanced at the clock, but everything seemed copasetic. It was four in the morning, and I heard movement in the coffee shop below. The cold water stung as I showered. I put together my bag with the days essentials, and dressed. A cute t-shirt, some tight jeans and a pair of flats adorned my fit frame.

I walked downstairs to see a man putting pastries in a display case and an older woman restocking a fridge with milk. The woman's name was Gretta and was both my new boss and land lord. She turned towards me as I stood at the bottom of the stair case. "Good morning, Kristen." She said. "Sleep well?"

"Yup. How can I help?

"Why don't you grab one of those bags of beans in the corner and refill the grinder."

I refilled the grinder, cleaned off a few of the machines and then made the three of us americanos. They both said thank you, but from what I could tell, they did not seem impressed.

The day went by fast. I spent the time cleaning, taking peoples money, making coffee and cleaning some more.

Around the end of the day though, a man made an order, and walked out of the store. While he was ordering, he gave Gretta a piece of paper. "What was that all about?" I inquired.

"We run a delivery business on the side. Basically we have got a group of people who need supplies in troubled parts of the city."

"Oh, that's pretty cool. Well, do you mind if I take off? I've got some errands I need to run."


"Actually, I was hoping you would do this delivery for us. Do you have some time?"

"Sure. I can take care of my errands later."

"Fantastic. Go to 254 Market St. and deliver that black thermos on the counter to Mike Bruchez." Her husband tossed me the thermos. "And try to get there in under an hour. He's all paid up, but he'll probably have a delivery or something for you to run. We'll see you tomorrow morning." I grabbed my backpack and shoved the thermos inside. As I headed for the door, they told me to take the green road bike leaning next to the door.

I hoped on the bike and started biking up hill. I headed for West Portal. The Muni went underground there, and the tunnel ran all the way to Embarcadero, the opposite side of the city. A few years back they actually paved a bike path next to the train tracks. It is the fastest way to get downtown, but you tend to have to deal with a lot of unsavory characters. I decided to go for it, but I had a feeling it wouldn't go well.

I flew down the hill leading to the Muni station. I was hoping maybe a train was going to be sitting there to make my trip easy, but alas, the next train was two hours out. I entered the station, and got onto the bike path. Slowly my eyes adjusted to the glow of tunnel lighting. I checked my pistol, and started riding into the dim corridor.

I traversed the pathways full of homeless people. The city was still running for the most part, even though money was quickly running out. Cops still roamed the tunnel, clearing out dead bodies and keeping the peace. While many of the lights still lit the tunnel, all of the security cameras had been destroyed long ago.

As I rode up the ramp the delivered me from the tunnel onto the Civic Center platform, two police officers were cleaning up what looked like a shootout between a homeless guy and gang banger. While the homeless guy had three or four bullet holes in him and sat dead and slumped over in his own pool of shit and blood, the gang banger was missing a leg and had two stab wounds in his stomach. Not sure how he lost his leg, but the sight of the two made me vomit in my mouth a little. I decided to run up the stairs instead of wallowing in the smell of death on the slow escalator.

Once above ground, I hop on my bicycle and head down Market street. I get a few hoots and hollers from the native inhabitants, but in general it's pretty cold, so people are staring into trash can fires more than looking around.

I hear a gunshot behind me and start pedaling faster to get the fuck out of there. I pedal towards the bay. According to my phone, which is relaying directions to my ear, I need to go to a building on the corner of Market and Pine. The street numbers on my right get smaller and I pass streets like O'Farrell and Geary. A year or two ago, I probably would be freaking out about now. I thankfully have never been shot, but I have watched a man get ten bullets put into him just for sitting on some old lady's bench. I've seen a twelve year old kid walk into an Apple store with a shotgun and kill twelve people, only to take a single bullet to the dome from an employee who had come into work late, but was carrying a Glock.

"Fuck." I pull over my bike over to the side of the street. My eyes close. I turn my head to the right and casually wretch all over an old newspaper stand. Being on the second story of that Apple store, the shotgun shots weren't what bothered me, I think because the buckshot pretty much disfigured the bodies. But the single bullet that I watched turn a small child's head into a crater was not a memory I really wanted to have. I shuddered and washed my mouth out with some water from my backpack.

Some lady starts yelling at me for being inconsiderate or something.

I get back on the bike and after a little more riding, arrive at the place. The building is huge. I stare upwards towards the sky, and guess that the building is at least two hundred stories or so. I wish I had some of those fancy glasses that provided statistics from the internet about whatever you were looking at.

I walk inside and see that there is a receptionist. Money says that her glasses tell her everything about me. "Good morning Ms. Cornwall." Called it. "How can I help you?"

"Hi there, I have a delivery for a Mike Bruchez."

"Ah alright. He's on the 127th floor. The elevator to the right of the desk will take you to his office."

"Cool, thanks."

The elevator was button-less, but right after I enter, the doors close and it takes off. While there are no windows, the round elevator has screens that spring to life and display a three hundred and sixty degree view, as if the building wasn't there and I was flying into the sky in Willie Wonka's Glass Elevator.

The elevator slows down, and comes to a complete stop. The screens fade and begin displaying wood panels on the walls. The doors slide open.

Standing in the door is a very lanky and malnourished man in a suit worth more than everything I owned.

He extends his arm for a handshake. "Hello. I'm Mike." I shake his hand and stare into his eyes. "I have a package for you Mr. Bruchez." He releases my hand. "Ah yes, do come in."

I think his accent is British, but I am not entirely sure. Something from that part of the world for sure. I remove the thermos from my pack and follow him to a couch, where he sits down. "Please, take a seat." I sit. "Is that it?" I hand him the tube. As he grabs it, and both of our hands are on the thermos turns blue. A green line appears on the blue and makes a wave form as a voice eminates from the tube. "Do you accept the delivery Mike Bruchez?" He smiles. "Yes I do. Thank you. Please tip fifteen percent."

"Thank you for your business." The tube flashes green twice and turns back to brushed aluminum.

He looks down at the tube and starts to twist the top. "Do you know what this is?"

"I had kind of assumed it was coffee, but with that fancy of a delivery tube, I'm starting to think not." He smiles at my joke and starts to pull on the top. The container reveals a cell phone, a folding pistol, two clips of ammo and a roll of cash.

"This is a job for you." His smile disappears as he looks at me. "Our coffee shop is just a front. I need you to go kill someone." I look at him like he's crazy. Because let's be honest, he's quickly proving to be crazy.

## Chapter Three

While I admit, I've never killed anyone before, I have been looking for a new career. Being a barista obviously only pays for rent, and my money from fashion was good but not great. "Uhmmm. Could you provide a few more details?"

He bursts out laughing. "Oh boy, you should have seen your face. That was priceless." He catches his breath and stops laughing so hard. "We aren't an assassin service, more of a delivery service that tends to run into a little trouble." He pushes the tubes contents to me. "Essentially what you just did was a trial run. Would you get here on time, be polite and not try and open the container." He stands and walks towards the window. "Essentially our delivery service is like game. You get points for delivering early and you get points depending on the troubles you evade. You can trade those points in for cash, buy nicer places to stay that we own, health care, new equipment, or even favors." He looks back to me. "Does this interest you? You'll also get points for just working the coffee shop, so you can take what's on the table and not do anything with it, but I would greatly appreciate it if you start doing more for our company."

I start fiddling with the gun in my hand. It is well built and light. It holds twenty rounds per clip and looks pretty durable. "Sure. Why not? This sounds pretty cool."

"Fantastic! Your second delivery will be even easier than this one. I will have a car waiting downstairs, all you need to do is pick up dinner for the coffee shop and deliver everything in the trunk in under thirty minutes."

"Seems easy enough."

"It is!" He hands me the keys as we walk towards the elevator door. "If you run into trouble, there is a sub-machine gun under the drivers seat."

"What do I do with the car when I am done?"

"Just leave it at the shop, you can use it until it gets stolen or destroyed."

And with that, I stepped into the elevator and fell towards the ground.

## Chapter Four

The drive back was pretty simple. People do not really mess with cars. The only real downside was having to drive around the big hills in the center of the city, instead of going through them. Historically, only the wealthy lived up in the hills, but in reality, it was the wealthy and the police officers. The police have blockaded most of the roads going into the hills, but rumor has it, they are building some sort of compound up there.

I meandered through the Haight and then through inner-sunset. A few years ago, I would have driven through the park, but you can't do that anymore. A large contingent of university students took over all of Golden Gate Park. They built community housing in various buildings throughout the park, and have been developing blockades. Rumor has it there is a small city in the parking garages under the art museum. Thankfully though, at least according to rumor, they haven't destroyed any art and are taking care of the animals in the science museum.

A turret tracked me as I came down Lincoln Way and turned onto 19th Avenue. One guy sitting at the trigger, while I glance at a couple making out up in the tree behind him.

I make it home, drop off my delivery and head upstairs. I turn on some music and lay down on my couch.

 > I brought you something close to me,  
 > Left for something you see though your here.  
 > You haunt my dreams  
 > There's nothing to do but believe,  
 > Just believe.  
 > Just breathe.  

My eyes close. French electronic music rolls over me. My theory is that life is better in France, based off of what music says, but every francophone I've met is a total asshole.

 > Another day, just believe,  
 > Another day, just breathe  
 > Another day, just believe,  
 > Another day. Just breathe.  

I sigh.

 > I'm used to it by now.  
 > Another day, just believe.  
 > Just breathe. Just believe.  
 > Just breathe.  
 > Lying in my bed,  
 > Another day, staring at the ceiling.  

 > Just breathe. Another day.  
 > Another day, just believe.  
 > Another day.  
 > I'm used to it by now.  
 > I'm used to it by now.  
 > Just breathe. Just believe.  
 > Just breathe. Just believe.  
 > Just believe. Just breathe.  
 > Just believe.  
 > Another day, just believe.  
 > Another day.  
 > Another day, just believe,  
 > Another day, just breathe,  
 > Another day (I do believe).  
 > Another day (so hard to breathe)  
 > Another day (not so hard to believe)  
 > Another day. Another day.

As the song finishes, someone knocks on my door. "Who is it?"

"Time for work."

Fuck. Well, this should be interesting. "Alright, one second." I throw on some comfy shoes and put on some warm clothes. I make sure my pack is fully stocked and hide the cash in the delivery tube in the toilet water reservoir.

I open the door to find another tube chilling on the floor. As soon as I pick it up, it begins to turn yellow. A voice emanates from somewhere inside the metal. "This package needs to be delivered to Christopher Fung outside of the Travis Air Force Base main gate by oh two hundred hours tonight. Because this is a night delivery you will receive one hundred and fifty percent your normal compensation rate. Do you accept delivery responsibility?"

The specificity surprises me, but ... "Yes."

"Mission engaged. Best of luck in your travels Ms. Cornwall." I shove the canister into my pack as the light fades. My phone must have heard the address, because now that the room was silent, it began giving me biking directions. "Correction Siri, I am taking a car." The phone processes briefly. "Will this be the car you arrived in?" I start walking down the stairs. "Yup. Give me the fastest route with no police please."

"Route selected. Please continue down the stairs and out the front door to your vehicle." I jumped the last three stairs. "Alright, mind queueing up some music in the car for me Siri?" There was a hot americano sitting on the counter, steam rising into the dark. I smiled. "Music playlist built for fast driving and heightened adrenaline."

I hopped in the car and pressed the ignition button. Car was full of gas, and the bass started pumping out. As I hit the gas, the volume from the car increased.

The car flew down 280 North. It definitely wasn't meant to go over eighty miles an hour, and here I was pushing it to slightly below one hundred miles per hour. I felt like Will Smith in Men In Black. Totally outside of my safety zone, flying down the road in an old Crown Vic. If only I was not driving, and I had Tommy Lee Jones showing me the ropes.

I merge onto the bay bridge. Rumor has it, the ghost bridge to the right used to actually be the most common way for people to get into the city, but now it just houses people. Instead I rumble across the new twenty lane monstrosity the gets everyone across the bay.

I have no idea who is getting the bill as I drive through the automatic toll, but the car's dash flashes green as it pays wirelessly. I keep heading north as I get off the bridge. After driving for an hour or so, I get off the freeway. After driving a little ways, I see the left turn to the base is barricaded off, and there is a lone man sitting on top of the barricade. I roll down my window and yell up to him. "Mr. Fung?"

"Yup. Call me Chris. You the delivery girl?" He is wearing an all black track suit, and has some sort of compound bow attached to his back.

"Indeed I am." He hops down and crosses the street. I pull out the tube from my pack, and extend it out the window. "What are you doing out here anyways?" He grabs the tube, and it turns blue. "I accept this delivery, five percent tip." It turns green and I let go. He look towards the base. "Oh, just a little bit of mischief." He starts to walk away, but then turns back. "Want to help us out? It could be a little dangerous, but it should be a lot of fun."

"Uhm. Alright, sure I guess." I parked the car on the side of the street and hoped out. "So what are we doing?"

"Well, we're going to break onto the base, steal some stuff, and hopefully blow some shit up." He grins kind of creepily. "Follow me."

We wander along the barrier for a while, until we come a small spot where someone had carved foot holds into the wall. Chris climbs up first and I follow. He jumps down quickly from the top. Before I jump, I hear voices and realize there are people down below.

I land with a thud, but it doesn't hurt too much.

As I stand up, I see Chris get handed a rifle, and someone approaches me and hands me a rifle and a string of grenades, and then walks off without a word. To say that I am slightly worried what I have gotten myself into is an understatement.

I store the grenades around my waste and check the rifle. I wish I was slightly better dressed for this, but I am wearing slightly dark clothes, so I guess it is OK.

We form up into groups of five. Chris is leading our group. He shines a flashlight onto the ground, and it is really a map projection. He explains our mission briefly and shows our breach point onto the base, and the hanger that is our final objective. He also points out our three escape points. We all nod, check our weapons and move out.

## Chapter Five

His mind was a blur. He had been juggling too many projects lately, and he couldn't keep track of them anymore. The solution was no longer coffee. He needed sleep, and he needed it badly. But before he moved across the room to his bed, Sol had one last thing to finish. His fingers flew across the keyboard, this function would be the last he hoped.

With a heavy key press, he saved the file and launched his test suite. Green dots flew across the screen. As long as none of the dots appear red, his code will be ready for the world. Probably the coolest part of some of the intellectual property laws passed in the last five years were the ones that required all software to be open source. It meant that Sol could write code to provide alternate reality projections for all HUD glasses wearers, all he had to do was submit a patch to the maintainers.

The last green dot appeared. On the next line, "TESTS: PASSED" appears. Sol punches his right fist into the air as he types out his submission email to the project maintainer with his left. As soon as he sends it off, he stumbles across the room, and collapses onto his bed. A successful night, falling asleep as the sun begins to rise.

## Chapter Six

Greg wakes up to many pull requests. This long list of people who want to change and fix the product that makes him millions every year. A few of the requests update the manufacturing process, so he leaves those until he has a little more coffee in him. A few others are small bug fixes, which Greg eagerly accepts.

There are two large feature additions though. The first is a prank Greg quickly denies. Some kid thinking it would be hilarious if people randomly saw unicorns in their peripheral vision twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. But the second one, now this was interesting. A system that allowed for people to define reality layers artificially based on data sources, and let people manipulate their defined realities on a per-pair-of-glasses basis.

Greg is stoked, this makes life so much easier he thinks. Now people can create subscribe-able realities! Greg creates a quick Wikipedia based reality. He changes the rules so that every object he points at, the first Wikipedia sentence is read into his ears. Fantastic. The contributor had provided a body replacement channel. He had set it so every horse now had a unicorn horn on it.

Greg eagerly accepted the patch, and submit it to the build system to deploy to all glasses. In the next hour or two, HUD systems around the world would start updating to the latest version Greg had created.

## Chapter Seven

I hold a cover position as one of our teammates breaches the fence with some sort of laser cutting device. As soon as the hole has been created, we file through, one be one. Our snipper takes out a guard on one of the watch towers. When the second one walks around to check on the thud the guard's dead body made, he too takes a bullet directly through his skull.

I take point as we navigate from parked truck to storage container to random building to more parked vehicles. I gain a nice pair of HUD glasses off the seat of an old Jeep. One of the other members of our infiltration squad finds some C4 in one of the soldiers lockers. All of us gain a few MREs and other random supplies.

As I turn a corner, I find a soldier on smoke break. I implant the butt of my rifle into his skull, and he falls quickly. One of the others helps me drag the body and heave it into a dumpster. Two of the other guys scout around to see if our loud noises attracted any attention. 

We take out two more guards in similar fashion, and find ourselves at the side entrance to the hanger. The hanger seems empty as we move through it. I shoot out two security cameras, and the sound of gun shots makes me a little more jumpy. Rifles are really loud.

Chris sticks his right arm up signaling for us to stop. He points at me, "come here" he says. I nod and shuffle over. "How often do you get to see inside your deliveries?"

I lie. "Not too often." 

"Well then, here is a treat." He opens the tube and three sets of keys slide out. All three are labeled. One says "Ride", another "Fuel", and then "Chest". Chris throws the "Ride" key to the team member who helped me move the first body, and then the "Fuel" key to another. "You three, go get us our flight home. We'll finish up here." They all nod and peel off. He pockets the third set of keys. "Come on. Let's go steal us some stuff."

We keep moving until Chris points out a black shipping container with tons of cables going into it. We approach the front entrance, and Chris hands me the keys. "Open the door and take cover behind it, I'll take point."

"Alright." I take the keys from his hand and insert them into the recessed key slot. As I turn the key, the bars running vertically pull inwards. I look at Chris and he nods. He aims his rifle at the door.

I pull the door open, but I can't see what's inside. I see Chris lower his gun and approach the entrance with his hands in a "Whoa there, I'm not going to hurt you" gesture. I peer around the corner and see three teenagers standing in worn out clothes. I put my gun down and come around the corner as well. Chris is kneeling and talking with them quietly. I notice behind them there are three desks with computers on them, and large server racks in the back. I also notice there are beds made out of piles of clothes or something under each of the desks. "I would like to hire you, and take you away from this place. What say you?" The three glance at each other and walk back to their desks. They type a little, almost as if they are having a conversation. The girl and one of the boys seem to be typing the most while the third just types a little. After about a minute, they close their computers, gather a few things into ruck sacks and approach Chris and I. "We will come with you" the girl says. "But if you back out of our arrangement, we will kill you."

"Seems reasonable to me." Chris says. I look at him in curiously. "Do I even want to know what arrangement?" 

"Probably not. You take the rear, lets get out of here."

We start walking towards the main hanger doors, when somewhere else, a large explosion goes off. The bass hits me in the chest like a train hits a suicidal pedestrian.

Chris starts to run.

The five of us reach the hanger doors. They seem to be manually operated, so I shoot the lock off, and we push one of the doors open enough. Chris is the last through the opening, and once he is, he chucks his entire grenade belt back through the door.

More explosions are going off throughout the compound.

My adrenaline is through the roof. "Get in the chopper!" I here Chris yell. "What fucking chopper?" I hear one of the kids respond. Then, from behind us, from literally out of nowhere, a helicopter flies over head and lands. It is running almost completely silently even when it touches down. I feel the bass and wind from the wing blades, but there is next to no sound coming from them. 

The side door opens and two of our previous team members starting gesturing for us to come closer. "That fucking chopper!" I respond. We all resume running and get through the door.

"Well that was interesting. Everyone alright?" I ask once we are all inside.

The shorter boy responds, "Yes, the three of us are fine. Thank you." 

"My name is Olivia. What are your names?"

"Uhm." says the girl as she glances at the other two. "My name is Trinity."

"I am called Stuart." The taller boy stands up and shakes my hand. "I am Brett" the shorter one says from his seat.

"Wow, Olivia, I am hurt. You never told me your name." Chris says leaning up against the door.

"Well you never asked. That is your own damn fault."

"Ha. Very true." Chris says with a smile. A green light flashes above us. Chris slides the door open showing my car on the freeway. "Well Olivia, this is your stop. Thanks for all of the help."

"Oh. Ok. This was interesting." I turn to the trio. "Hey, if you ever need a delivery done, shoot me a message, I extend my contact info to the girl."

"Oh. Thank you Olivia. It was nice meeting you."

"It was nice meeting you as well." I wave goodbye to them. I extend my hand to Chris, "hey, thanks for this. It was an experience. Mind if I keep the munitions?"

"Sure. It was my pleasure. If you ever get tired of your current job or need a little mischief created, hit me up." He hands me a paper business card with one hand and shakes my hand with the other one.

I jump down, salute the pilot and run to the car. I open my door and look back at where the copper was, and it is already flying away as fast as it can.

I chuck my stuff inside onto the passenger seat and drive home. I keep looking in the rear view mirror, but all I see is the glow from the chaos, and no one is following me. 

"Damn this city is strange"

## Chapter Eight

Sol awoke to the sunset. "Fuck." He muttered. "I needed a god damn haircut." He shuffled over to his computer. He had a lot of emails. "Ugh." He yawned. "Computer. Order one large pizza with mushrooms, peperoni, bacon, onions and uhm..."

"Uhm is not a valid topping" a synthesized female voice responded from his phone.

"Ah fuck you. Add tomatoes to my order and read it back to me please."

"You would like to order one large pizza with bacon, mushrooms, onions, peperoni and tomatoes. Correct?"

"Ya, order that shit for delivery."

"Ordering."

"Thank you." Sol started reading through his emails. There was a big thread about his patch. Apparently everyone was stoked about the idea, but were somewhat disappointed greg_the_god had gone and deprecated every module that now needed to be rewritten using his new uber-module. Some developers had already released new versions of their modules. Greg must be stoked, it was really shrinking the code base and its dependency graph.

"Pizza will be delivered in forty-five minutes." The voice from his phone echoed out.

"Aight." Sol hops into the shower and cleans himself. He dries off and puts on some semi-clean clothes. At least they don't smell. He keeps reading email, and then when completed, he launches his build setup. "Computer, display data about the next ten hours on the window." Sol has floor to ceiling windows for the entire south facing wall. He glances over. "Sol," his phone chimes out, "it is currently five pm on Friday. It is supposed to drop to forty degrees tonight. You asked me to remind you that you wanted to run your data analyzer on the people at bars tonight." 

"No need to run through the news. Thanks computer." Sol starts coding. He has been building a data source for his module that shows data streams coming out of people, and data streams people are consuming. If it works, Sol will be super happy. 

Pizza arrives, Sol consumes and keeps coding. Around midnight, he kicks off his build for the data stream and closes his eyes to grab the latest master build for his HUD. Long ago the HUD switched to only doing updates when you were sleeping. The problem with this is that new builds come out every hour, So you only get the build active when you first go to sleep. Because of that, most developers had learned how to lure their bodies into a pseudo-trance state to convince their HUDs to update whenever they needed.

His build finishes and begins testing. Sol opens his eyes. His HUD flashes the current build number and then fades into his customized view. "Hud: subscribe to 'Sol's rivers of data' stream". Sol stands up and walks over to his mirror. He sees a few blue streams coming out of him, the data he is emitting, and a ton of white streams coming into him, the data he is consuming. 

A simple bell rings signifying the new version of his river stream is live to its subscribers. "Hud: set action, left thumb to left ring finger tap, toggle river display." His vision quickly fades light green and back signifying conformation. Still looking in the mirror, he taps his thumb to his ring finger. All of a sudden the rivers disappear and a list of streams appears next to his face, sorted by interest to Sol. Sol smiles a huge grin, throws on his jacket and shoes, and walks out the door to try his new tool on the drunken masses of Manhattan.

## Chapter Nine

"So where are we going Mr. Chris?" Trinity asks as she stretches her arms. They had been in the air for at least two hours. She didn't think any of her compatriots trusted Chris that much, but being anywhere outside of that shipping container was a plus. Trinity just wished it wasn't another metal box.

"We're going to LA. Once there we will switch to a plane and fly to NYC."

"Uhmm. So we're banned from New York City. Ever since we crashed their entire electric grid when the governor declared a police state."

"Oh ya, I remember that. I didn't know that was you three."

"We have been the United States' top hackers for the last five years."

"Ha. Good point. Well I've got the three of you knew identities. I had created random fake names, but it seems like you've beat me to that. Should I have your documents changed to reflect the names you gave miss Cornwall?"

"Who?"

"Olivia. Her last name was Cornwall. She does deliveries for a friend of mine."

"She does more than that." Brett chimed in. "She is also a relatively successful indie fashion designer."

"Well, fancy that."

Trinity smiles. Seeing Brett crush on a girl is always hilarious. He's probably already built a stalker tool for her. Oh well, Trinity thinks to herself, we probably will not see her again for awhile.
