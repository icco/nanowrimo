  This is the way the world ends
  Not with a bang but a whimper
    -- T.S. Elliott

In the fall of 2015, I was living in San Francisco. San Francisco is a fantastic place in autumn. The season starts with what the locals call "Indian Summer" (which is actually a meteorological term, according to the internet), where it is sunny all day and the temperature stays in the high seventies. Then the weather starts to cool down. My walk to the bus turns into a swim through pea soup fog. If London still had fog, I would imagine it being far less dense than this.

It was Saturday and I was walking downhill after getting off of the Muni at West Portal. The fog was impenetrable, but I kept moving on. The beautiful thing about the city, is that if you keep heading downhill, you will get to the ocean. As I walk, I enter a new section of the city, affectionately known as Parkside, is strange. It is full of Chinese and Irish folks. So, all of the breakfast places serve Irish Coffee, corn beef and hash, and steamed pork buns. The ice cream parlor serves hamburgers, ice cream, bobba tea and fried rice. Halloween must have been nearby, because the chef at the Thai restaurant I passed was dressed as a ninja.

I kept walking. Google had recently released their new in-ear headphones, so I was walking to some deep trance. The heavy beats and quiet melodies kept me moving deeper and deeper into the fog and down the hill. The headphones that were essentially tattooed behind my ears quieted the music as a car flew by. I pulled my hood over my head as the fog turned into a wet mist. The music picked back up.

I said hello to a cute girl passing by, my music quieted for a moment again, awaiting incoming conversation, but she just smiled and kept walking up hill. I glanced back, briefly, but saw no turn from her. I put my hands into my jacket pocket and kept moving.

The mist thinned a little, and the hill flattened out. I crossed the street and climbed to the top of the dunes, and I saw the large chunks of junk washing up on the shore. I scrambled up to the top of the cement barricade, sat down on the edge and pulled out my thermos and pork buns.
