## Chapter One

In the fall of 2016, I was living in San Francisco. San Francisco is a fantastic place in autumn. The season starts with what the locals call "Indian Summer" (which is actually a meteorological term, according to the internet), where it is sunny all day and the temperature stays in the high seventies. Then the weather starts to cool down. My walk to the bus turns into a swim through pea soup fog. If London still had fog, I would imagine it being far less dense than this.

It was Saturday and I was walking downhill after getting off of the Muni at West Portal. The fog was impenetrable, but I kept moving on. The beautiful thing about the city, is that if you keep heading downhill, you will get to the ocean. As I walk, I enter a new section of the city, affectionately known as Parkside, is strange. It is full of Chinese and Irish folks. So, all of the breakfast places serve Irish Coffee, corn beef and hash, and steamed pork buns. The ice cream parlor serves hamburgers, ice cream, bobba tea and fried rice. Halloween must have been nearby, because the chef at the Thai restaurant I passed was dressed as a ninja.

I kept walking. Google had recently released their new in-ear headphones, so I was walking to some deep trance. The heavy beats and quiet melodies kept me moving deeper and deeper into the fog and down the hill. The headphones that were essentially tattooed behind my ears quieted the music as a car flew by. I pulled my hood over my head as the fog turned into a wet mist. The music picked back up.

I said hello to a cute guy passing by, my music quieted for a moment again, awaiting incoming conversation, but she just smiled and kept walking up hill. I glanced back, briefly, but saw no turn from him. I put my hands into my jacket pocket and kept moving.

The mist thinned a little, and the hill flattened out. I crossed the street and climbed to the top of the dunes, and I saw the large chunks of junk washing up on the shore. I scrambled up to the top of the cement barricade, sat down on the edge and pulled out my thermos of hot jasmine tea and a box of steamed pork buns. My backpack was something I had designed myself a few years back. Originally I designed it for outdoor concerts. It was a sling over one shoulder and formed a tight loop around your torso. The front had a small pocket, good for a cell phone or music device. The back was wider. It was meant to have room for a jacket, a large water bottle and a box of food. It also had small hidden pockets for stashing things like money or marijuana or condoms. There was also a false bottom for hiding a tall can of beer or two flasks. I ended up selling the design to a local backpack company, and it did not sell as well as I had hoped.

The junk floating up, was from the war. About a year ago, Japan, China, India and Russia's economies all essentially collapsed. Some company in Japan started building these boats that were some, that floated across the Pacific Ocean, each carrying around two hundred people. I think they stole the idea from some Neal Stephenson book, but when the first few arrived on the California coast near Santa Barbra, they were essentially coffins. The United States coast guard originally started turning the boats back, but most of them fell apart on the return journey. People on the other side must have assumed it was working, because two weeks later, three hundred ships were found crossing the Pacific. A month later, ten thousand ships were en-route to California. After several warnings, and the realization that the Chinese government had essentially funded the mass exodus, the President of the United States of America approved putting mines off the coast of California. Now bodies and wreckage are all that arrive on the San Francisco coast. The United Nations believes the United States is guilty of killing approximately ten million refugees.

Obviously, this did not go over well with the American people. Apparently, civil war broke out first in Colorado. I'm somewhat unclear of the specifics, because information has not been flowing quite as well as it used to. But Colorado's neighbors took up arms as well, soon "The Four Corners Union" was born. Soon to follow, "The State of Jefferson", containing about two thirds of California, and all of Oregon and Washington broke off as well. The war wasn't incredibly bloody. The Internet let people essential use flash mobs to take over military bases, and often many uniformed men and women joined to side of the rebellion.

So now, North America has four countries. The United States of America, Canada, The Four Corners Union and The State of Jefferson. Most of the battles seem to be in the capitol and at the United Nations. The biggest problem really, is that The State of Jefferson has adopted a very strict policy of Libertarianism, bordering on anarchy. So, in a city like San Francisco, shit is getting heavy. I started carrying a gun about a week ago, and version two of my backpack is selling like hot cakes (it adds a easy to access holder for a hand gun and specific storage for ammo and a gas mask internally). Initially I was pretty worried about being jumped, but I've found as long as I stay out of the Bart tunnels, the Tenderloin, and off of the Bay Bridge, I don't have to worry about being shot and raped. Rumor has it, Muni will run out of fuel soon, so I'm hoping to move out of the Financial district and into a flat above a coffee shop up near 25th Avenue. I've accepted a job to pay for the rent. Apparently people still drink coffee even though things are going to shit.

One of the bodies on the ocean twitches, and starts to move their arm. A turret to my right springs to life, targets the body, and puts an anti-tank round into the body. Salt water saturated flesh flies up into the air. I put my lunch away, check my gun, and jump down into the city. I walk away from the ocean, trying to remember what it was like playing on beaches as a child; but my mind keeps returning to the wreckage on the beach.

This city is toxic to my memories. I need to get out of here.

## Chapter Two

I was able to sell most of my possessions so I could carry everything in one trip, but I kept two bags of supplies, my laptop, and a semi-automatic rifle I stole from the Air Force base. I move into my new loft. It contains a couch, a TV and a bed. It even has a small fridge and hot plate. The bathroom worked, although there was no hot water. I did a little reading before falling asleep on the couch.

I awoke quickly to the sound of a bell. It took me a few seconds to grab my bearings as I glanced at the clock, but everything seemed copasetic. It was four in the morning, and I heard movement in the coffee shop below. The cold water stung as I showered. I put together my bag with the days essentials, and dressed. A cute t-shirt, some tight jeans and a pair of flats adorned my fit frame.

I walked downstairs to see a man putting pastries in a display case and an older woman restocking a fridge with milk. The woman's name was Gretta and was both my new boss and land lord. She turned towards me as I stood at the bottom of the stair case. "Good morning, Kristen." She said. "Sleep well?"

"Yup. How can I help?

"Why don't you grab one of those bags of beans in the corner and refill the grinder."

I refilled the grinder, cleaned off a few of the machines and then made the three of us americanos. They both said thank you, but from what I could tell, they did not seem impressed.

The day went by fast. I spent the time cleaning, taking peoples money, making coffee and cleaning some more.

Around the end of the day though, a man made an order, and walked out of the store. While he was ordering, he gave Gretta a piece of paper. "What was that all about?" I inquired.

"We run a delivery business on the side. Basically we have got a group of people who need supplies in troubled parts of the city."

"Oh, that's pretty cool. Well, do you mind if I take off? I've got some errands I need to run."


"Actually, I was hoping you would do this delivery for us. Do you have some time?"

"Sure. I can take care of my errands later."

"Fantastic. Go to 254 Market St. and deliver that black thermos on the counter to Mike Bruchez." Her husband tossed me the thermos. "And try to get there in under an hour. He's all paid up, but he'll probably have a delivery or something for you to run. We'll see you tomorrow morning." I grabbed my backpack and shoved the theromos inside. As I headed for the door, they told me to take the green road bike leaning next to the door.

I hoped on the bike and started biking up hill. I headed for West Portal. The Muni went underground there, and the tunnel ran all the way to Embarcadero, the opposite side of the city. A few years back they actually paved a bike path next to the train tracks. It is the fastest way to get downtown, but you tend to have to deal with a lot of unsavory characters. I decided to go for it, but I had a feeling it wouldn't go well.

I flew down the hill leading to the Muni station. I was hoping maybe a train was going to be sitting there to make my trip easy, but alas, the next train was two hours out. I entered the station, and got onto the bike path. Slowly my eyes adjusted to the glow of tunnel lighting. I checked my pistol, and started riding into the dim cooridor.

I traversed the pathways full of homeless people. The city was still running for the most part, even though money was quickly running out. Cops still roamed the tunnel, clearing out dead bodies and keeping the peace. While many of the lights still lit the tunnel, all of the security cameras had been destroyed long ago.

As I rode up the ramp the delivered me from the tunnel onto the Civic Center platform, two police officers were cleaning up what looked like a shootout between a homeless guy and gang banger. While the homeless guy had three or four bullet holes in him and sat dead and slumped over in his own pool of shit and blood, the gang banger was missing a leg and had two stab wounds in his stomache. Not sure how he lost his leg, but the sight of the two made me vomit in my mouth a little. I decided to run up the stairs instead of wallowing in the smell of death on the slow escalator.

Once above ground, I hop on my bycicle and head down Market street. I get a few hoots and holars from the native inhabitants, but in general it's pretty cold, so people are staring into trash can fires more than looking around.

I hear a gunshot behind me and start pedaling faster to get the fuck out of there. I peddal towards the bay. According to my phone, which is relaying directions to my ear, I need to go to a building on the corner of Market and Pine. The street numbers on my right get smaller and I pass streets like O'Farrell and Geary. A year or two ago, I probably would be freaking out about now. I thankfully have never been shot, but I have watched a man get ten bullets put into him just for sitting on some old lady's bench. I've seen a twelve year old kid walk into an Apple store with a shotgun and kill twelve people, only to take a single bullet to the dome from an employee who had come into work late, but was carrying a glock.

"Fuck." I pull over my bike over to the side of the street. My eyes close. I turn my head to the right and casually wretch all over an old newpaper stand. Being on the second story of that Apple store, the shotgun shots weren't what bothered me, I think because the buckshot pretty much disfigured the bodies. But the single bullet that I watched turn a small childs head into a crater was not a memory I really wanted to have. I shuddered and washed my mouth out with some water from my backpack. 

Some lady starts yelling at me for being incosiderate or something.

I get back on the bike and after a little more riding, arrive at the place. The building is huge. I stare upwards towards the sky, and guess that the building is at least two hundred stories or so. I wish I had some of those fancy glasses that provided statistics from the internet about whatever you were looking at.

I walk inside and see that there is a receptionist. Money says that her glasses tell her everything about me. "Good morning Ms. Cornwall." Called it. "How can I help you?"

"Hi there, I have a delivery for a Mike Bruchez."

"Ah alright. He's on the 127th floor. The elevator to the right of the desk will take you to his office."

"Cool, thanks."

The elevator was button-less, but right after I enter, the doors close and it takes off. While there are no windows, the round elevator has screens that spring to life and display a three hundred and sixty degree view, as if the building wasn't there and I was flying into the sky in Willie Wonka's Glass Elevator.

The elevator slows down, and comes to a complete stop. The screens fade and begin displaying wood panels on the walls. The doors slide open. 

Standing in the door is a very lanky and malnourished man in a suit worth more than everything I owned.

He extends his arm for a handshake. "Hello. I'm Mike." I shake his hand and stare into his eyes. "I have a package for you Mr. Bruchez." He releases my hand. "Ah yes, do come in."

I think his accent is British, but I am not entirely sure. Something from that part of the world for sure. I remove the thermos from my pack and follow him to a couch, where he sits down. "Please, take a seat." I sit. "Is that it?" I hand him the tube. As he grabs it, and both of our hands are on the theromos turns blue. A green line appears on the blue and makes a wave form as a voice eminates from the tube. "Do you accept the delivery Mike Bruchez?" He smiles. "Yes I do. Thank you. Please tip fifteen percent."

"Thank you for your business." The tube flashes green twice and turns back to brushed aluminum.

He looks down at the tube and starts to twist the top. "Do you know what this is?"

"I had kind of assumed it was coffee, but with that fancy of a delivery tube, I'm starting to think not." He smiles at my joke and starts to pull on the top. The container reveals a cell phone, a folding pistol, two clips of ammo and a roll of cash.

"This is a job for you." His smile disappears as he looks at me. "Our coffee shop is just a front. I need you to go kill someone." I look at him like he's crazy. Because let's be honest, he's quickly proving to be crazy.

## Chapter Three

While I admit, I've never killed anyone before, I have been looking for a new career. Being a barista obviously only pays for rent, and my money from fashion was good but not great. "Uhmmm. Could you provide a few more details?"

He bursts out laughing. "Oh boy, you should have seen your face. That was priceless." He catches his breath and stops laughing so hard. "We aren't an assassin service, more of a delivery service that tends to run into a little trouble." He pushes the tubes contents to me. "Essentially what you just did was a trial run. Would you get here on time, be polite and not try and open the container." He stands and walks towards the window. "Essentially our delivery service is like game. You get points for delivering early and you get points depending on the troubles you evade. You can trade those points in for cash, buy nicer places to stay that we own, health care, new equipment, or even favors." He looks back to me. "Does this interest you? You'll also get points for just working the coffee shop, so you can take what's on the table and not do anything with it, but I would greatly appreciate it if you start doing more for our company."

I start fiddling with the gun in my hand. It is well built and light. It holds twenty rounds per clip and looks pretty durable. "Sure. Why not? This sounds pretty cool."

"Fantastic! Your second delivery will be even easier than this one. I will have a car waiting downstairs, all you need to do is pick up dinner for the coffee shop and deliver everything in the trunk in under thirty minutes."

"Seems easy enough."

"It is!" He hands me the keys as we walk towards the elevator door. "If you run into trouble, there is a sub-machine gun under the drivers seat."

"What do I do with the car when I am done?"

"Just leave it at the shop, you can use it until it gets stolen or destroyed."

And with that, I stepped into the elevator and fell towards the ground.

## Chapter Four

The drive back was pretty simple. People do not really mess with cars. The only real downside was having to drive around the big hills in the center of the city, instead of going through them. Historically, only the wealthy lived up in the hills, but in reality, it was the wealthy and the police officers. The police have blockaded most of the roads going into the hills, but rumor has it, they are building some sort of compound up there.

I meandered through the Haight and then through inner-sunset. A few years ago, I would have driven through the park, but you can't do that anymore. A large contingent of university students took over all of Golden Gate Park. They built community housing in various buildings throughout the park, and have been developing blockades. Rumor has it there is a small city in the parking garages under the art museum. Thankfully though, at least according to rumor, they haven't destroyed any art and are taking care of the animals in the science museum.

A turret tracked me as I came down Lincoln Way and turned onto 19th Avenue. One guy sitting at the trigger, while I glance at a couple making out up in the tree behind him.

I make it home, drop off my delivery and head upstairs. I turn on some music and lay down on my couch.

 > I brought you something close to me,  
 > Left for something you see though your here.  
 > You haunt my dreams  
 > There's nothing to do but believe,  
 > Just believe.  
 > Just breathe.  

My eyes close. French electronic music rolls over me. My theory is that life is better in France, based off of what music says, but every francophone I've met is a total asshole.

 > Another day, just believe,  
 > Another day, just breathe  
 > Another day, just believe,  
 > Another day. Just breathe.  

I sigh.

 > I'm used to it by now.  
 > Another day, just believe.  
 > Just breathe. Just believe.  
 > Just breathe.  
 > Lying in my bed,  
 > Another day, staring at the ceiling.  

 > Just breathe. Another day.  
 > Another day, just believe.  
 > Another day.  
 > I'm used to it by now.  
 > I'm used to it by now.  
 > Just breathe. Just believe.  
 > Just breathe. Just believe.  
 > Just believe. Just breathe.  
 > Just believe.  
 > Another day, just believe.  
 > Another day.  
 > Another day, just believe,  
 > Another day, just breathe,  
 > Another day (I do believe).  
 > Another day (so hard to breathe)  
 > Another day (not so hard to believe)  
 > Another day. Another day.  

As the song finishes, someone knocks on my door. "Who is it?"

"Time for work."

Fuck. Well, this should be interesting. "Alright, one second." I throw on some comfy shoes and put on some warm clothes. I make sure my pack is fully stocked and hide the cash in the delivery tube in the toilet water reservoir.

I open the door to find another tube chilling on the floor. As soon as I pick it up, it begins to turn yellow. A voice emanates from somewhere inside the metal. "This package needs to be delivered to Christopher Fung outside of the Travis Air Force Base main gate by oh two hundred hours tonight. Because this is a night delivery you will receive one hundred and fifty percent your normal compensation rate. Do you accept delivery responsibility?"

The specificity surprises me, but ... "Yes."

"Mission engaged. Best of luck in your travels Ms. Cornwall." I shove the canister into my pack as the light fades. My phone must have heard the address, because now that the room was silent, it began giving me biking directions. "Correction Siri, I am taking a car." The phone processes briefly. "Will this be the car you arrived in?" I start walking down the stairs. "Yup. Give me the fastest route with no police please."

"Route selected. Please continue down the stairs and out the front door to your vehicle." I jumped the last three stairs. "Alright, mind queueing up some music in the car for me Siri?" There was a hot americano sitting on the counter, steam rising into the dark. I smiled. "Music playlist built for fast driving and heightened adrenaline."

I hopped in the car and pressed the ignition button. Car was full of gas, and the bass started pumping out. As I hit the gas, the volume from the car increased.

The car flew down 280 North. It definitly wasn't meant to go over eighty miles an hour, and here I was pushing it to slightly below one hundred miles per hour. I felt like Will Smith in Men In Black. Totally outside of my safety zone, flying down the road in an old Crown Vic. If only I was not driving, and I had Tommy Lee Jones showing me the ropes.

I merge onto the bay bridge. Rumor has it, the ghost bridge to the right used to actually be the most common way for people to get into the city, but now it just houses people.
