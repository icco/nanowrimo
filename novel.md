## Chapter One

In the fall of 2016, I was living in San Francisco. San Francisco is a fantastic place in autumn. The season starts with what the locals call "Indian Summer" (which is actually a meteorological term, according to the internet), where it is sunny all day and the temperature stays in the high seventies. Then the weather starts to cool down. My walk to the bus turns into a swim through pea soup fog. If London still had fog, I would imagine it being far less dense than this.

It was Saturday and I was walking downhill after getting off of the Muni at West Portal. The fog was impenetrable, but I kept moving on. The beautiful thing about the city, is that if you keep heading downhill, you will get to the ocean. As I walk, I enter a new section of the city, affectionately known as Parkside, is strange. It is full of Chinese and Irish folks. So, all of the breakfast places serve Irish Coffee, corn beef and hash, and steamed pork buns. The ice cream parlor serves hamburgers, ice cream, bobba tea and fried rice. Halloween must have been nearby, because the chef at the Thai restaurant I passed was dressed as a ninja.

I kept walking. Google had recently released their new in-ear headphones, so I was walking to some deep trance. The heavy beats and quiet melodies kept me moving deeper and deeper into the fog and down the hill. The headphones that were essentially tattooed behind my ears quieted the music as a car flew by. I pulled my hood over my head as the fog turned into a wet mist. The music picked back up.

I said hello to a cute guy passing by, my music quieted for a moment again, awaiting incoming conversation, but she just smiled and kept walking up hill. I glanced back, briefly, but saw no turn from him. I put my hands into my jacket pocket and kept moving.

The mist thinned a little, and the hill flattened out. I crossed the street and climbed to the top of the dunes, and I saw the large chunks of junk washing up on the shore. I scrambled up to the top of the cement barricade, sat down on the edge and pulled out my thermos of hot jasmine tea and a box of steamed pork buns. My backpack was something I had designed myself a few years back. Originally I designed it for outdoor concerts. It was a sling over one shoulder and formed a tight loop around your torso. The front had a small pocket, good for a cell phone or music device. The back was wider. It was meant to have room for a jacket, a large water bottle and a box of food. It also had small hidden pockets for stashing things like money or marijuana or condoms. There was also a false bottom for hiding a tall can of beer or two flasks. I ended up selling the design to a local backpack company, and it did not sell as well as I had hoped.

The junk floating up, was from the war. About a year ago, Japan, China, India and Russia's economies all essentially collapsed. Some company in Japan started building these boats that were some, that floated across the Pacific Ocean, each carrying around two hundred people. I think they stole the idea from some Neal Stephenson book, but when the first few arrived on the California coast near Santa Barbra, they were essentially coffins. The United States coast guard originally started turning the boats back, but most of them fell apart on the return journey. People on the other side must have assumed it was working, because two weeks later, three hundred ships were found crossing the Pacific. A month later, ten thousand ships were en-route to California. After several warnings, and the realization that the Chinese government had essentially funded the mass exodus, the President of the United States of America approved putting mines off the coast of California. Now bodies and wreckage are all that arrive on the San Francisco coast. The United Nations believes the United States is guilty of killing approximately ten million refugees.

Obviously, this did not go over well with the American people. Apparently, civil war broke out first in Colorado. I'm somewhat unclear of the specifics, because information has not been flowing quite as well as it used to. But Colorado's neighbors took up arms as well, soon "The Four Corners Union" was born. Soon to follow, "The State of Jefferson", containing about two thirds of California, and all of Oregon and Washington broke off as well. The war wasn't incredibly bloody. The Internet let people essential use flash mobs to take over military bases, and often many uniformed men and women joined to side of the rebellion.

So now, North America has four countries. The United States of America, Canada, The Four Corners Union and The State of Jefferson. Most of the battles seem to be in the capitol and at the United Nations. The biggest problem really, is that The State of Jefferson has adopted a very strict policy of Libertarianism, bordering on anarchy. So, in a city like San Francisco, shit is getting heavy. I started carrying a gun about a week ago, and version two of my backpack is selling like hot cakes (it adds a easy to access holder for a hand gun and specific storage for ammo and a gas mask internally). Initially I was pretty worried about being jumped, but I've found as long as I stay out of the Bart tunnels, the Tenderloin, and off of the Bay Bridge, I don't have to worry about being shot and raped. Rumor has it, Muni will run out of fuel soon, so I'm hoping to move out of the Financial district and into a flat above a coffee shop up near 25th Avenue. I've accepted a job to pay for the rent. Apparently people still drink coffee even though things are going to shit.

One of the bodies on the ocean twitches, and starts to move their arm. A turret to my right springs to life, targets the body, and puts an anti-tank round into the body. Salt water saturated flesh flies up into the air. I put my lunch away, check my gun, and jump down into the city. I walk away from the ocean, trying to remember what it was like playing on beaches as a child; but my mind keeps returning to the wreckage on the beach.

This city is toxic to my memories. I need to get out of here.

## Chapter Two

I was able to sell most of my possessions so I could carry everything in one trip, but I kept two bags of supplies, my laptop, and a semi-automatic rifle I stole from the Air Force base. I move into my new loft. It contains a couch, a TV and a bed. It even has a small fridge and hot plate. The bathroom worked, although there was no hot water. I did a little reading before falling asleep on the couch.

I awoke quickly to the sound of a bell. It took me a few seconds to grab my bearings as I glanced at the clock, but everything seemed copasetic. It was four in the morning, and I heard movement in the coffee shop below. The cold water stung as I showered. I put together my bag with the days essentials, and dressed. A cute t-shirt, some tight jeans and a pair of flats adorned my fit frame.

I walked downstairs to see a man putting pastries in a display case and an older woman restocking a fridge with milk. The woman's name was Gretta and was both my new boss and land lord. She turned towards me as I stood at the bottom of the stair case. "Good morning, Kristen." She said. "Sleep well?"

"Yup. How can I help?

"Why don't you grab one of those bags of beans in the corner and refill the grinder."

I refilled the grinder, cleaned off a few of the machines and then made the three of us americanos. They both said thank you, but from what I could tell, they did not seem impressed. 

The day went by fast. I spent the time cleaning, taking peoples money, making coffee and cleaning some more.

Around the end of the day though, a man made an order, and walked out of the store. While he was ordering, he gave Gretta a piece of paper. "What was that all about?" I inquired.

"You have to make a delivery."

"Oh."

"Go to 254 Market St. with this thermos." Her husband tossed me a thermos. "And get there in under an hour. Once you're done, you can have the rest of the day off."
