  This is the way the world ends
  Not with a bang but a whimper
    -- T.S. Elliott

In the fall of 2015, I was living in San Francisco. San Francisco is a fantastic place in autumn. The season starts with what the locals call "Indian Summer" (which is actually a meteorological term, according to the internet), where it is sunny all day and the temperature stays in the high seventies. Then the weather starts to cool down. My walk to the bus turns into a swim through pea soup fog. If London still had fog, I would imagine it being far less dense than this.
