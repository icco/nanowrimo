  This is the way the world ends
  Not with a bang but a whimper
    -- T.S. Elliott

In the fall of 2015, I was living in San Francisco. San Francisco is a fantastic place in autumn. The season starts with what the locals call "Indian Summer" (which is actually a meteorological term, according to the internet), where it is sunny all day and the temperature stays in the high seventies. Then the weather starts to cool down. My walk to the bus turns into a swim through pea soup fog. If London still had fog, I would imagine it being far less dense than this.

It was Saturday and I was walking downhill after getting off of the Muni at West Portal. The fog was impenetrable, but I kept moving on. The beautiful thing about the city, is that if you keep heading downhill, you will get to the ocean. As I walk, I enter a new section of the city, affectionately known as Parkside, is strange. It is full of Chinese and Irish folks. So, all of the breakfast places serve Irish Coffee, corn beef and hash, and steamed pork buns. The ice cream parlor serves hamburgers, ice cream, bobba tea and fried rice. Halloween must have been nearby, because the chef at the Thai restaurant I passed was dressed as a ninja.
