A young man stood on the beach. He slowly breathed, his breath visible in the cold as if he was smoking a cigar. The fog was everywhere, it apparently used to burn off, but now it just hung there.

The fog has tinted red as the sun slowly set. The man just sat there in silence. No one walked by, and few sounds reached his ears except for the waves pulsating on the beach. A muffled series of clicks happened behind the man. He turned to see the street lamps slowly lit by their owners as the light from the sky faded, and then continued to watch the dark waves roll in.

As the tide slowly receded, he started walking back up the street behind him. Ten cold and wet blocks later, he walked through a door under a blue tinted lamp.

Inside was a bar. A few wooden tables were scattered across the room. One was occupied with a young woman reading; Another was taken by a couple talking quietly and sipping beer. At the bar, one of the four stools was occupied by a man reading through the news and drinking a tumbler full of some dark alcohol.

The young man approached the bar and grabbed a stool. He rotated on and stared at the two unmarked taps. Then he quietly cleared his throat.

"Michelangelo? Could I have a pint of the right beer?"

Michelangelo, a middle aged man with a light brown short beard and a heavily tattooed left-arm peeked his head out from the open doorway behind the bar, "Hey-ah Bridge! Lemme just finish tweaking this and I'll be with you in a sec."

Bridge smiled. "Break the security perimeter again?"

"No comment! I think I got the parameters right this time though." Michelangelo yelled as a loud thunk came from the back room.

Bridge chuckled and drew a square in the air in front of him. As he did, a little wisp of smoke poured from his coat sleeve and filed the imaginary square. The smoke stopped pouring and began to thicken. Then it solidified and small blue words started to appear on the thin slab of smoke.
