A young man stood on the beach. He slowly breathed, his breath visible in the cold as if he was smoking a cigar. The fog was everywhere, it apparently used to burn off, but now it just hung there.

The fog has tinted red as the sun slowly set. The man just sat there in silence. No one walked by, and few sounds reached his ears except for the waves pulsating on the beach. A muffled series of clicks happened behind the man. He turned to see the street lamps slowly lit by their owners as the light from the sky faded.
