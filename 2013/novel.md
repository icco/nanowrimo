Neo San Francisco, 2050

## Chapter 1

A young man stood on the beach. He slowly breathed, his breath visible in the cold as if he was smoking a cigar. The fog was everywhere, it apparently used to burn off, but now it just hung there.

The fog has tinted red as the sun slowly set. The man just sat there in silence. No one walked by, and few sounds reached his ears except for the waves pulsating on the beach. A muffled series of clicks happened behind the man. He turned to see the street lamps slowly lit by their owners as the light from the sky faded, and then continued to watch the dark waves roll in.

As the tide slowly receded, he started walking back up the street behind him. Ten cold and wet blocks later, he walked through a door under a blue tinted lamp.

Inside was a bar. A few wooden tables were scattered across the room. One was occupied with a young woman reading; Another was taken by a couple talking quietly and sipping beer. At the bar, one of the four stools was occupied by a man reading through the news and drinking a tumbler full of some dark alcohol.

The young man approached the bar and grabbed a stool. He rotated on and stared at the two unmarked taps. Then he quietly cleared his throat.

"Michelangelo? Could I have a pint of the right beer?"

Michelangelo, a middle aged man with a light brown short beard and a heavily tattooed left-arm peeked his head out from the open doorway behind the bar, "Hey-ah Bridge! Let me just finish tweaking this and I'll be with you in a sec."

Bridge smiled. "Break the security perimeter again?"

"No comment! I think I got the parameters right this time though." Michelangelo yelled as a loud thunk came from the back room.

Bridge chuckled and drew a square in the air in front of him. As he did, a little wisp of smoke poured from his coat sleeve and filed the imaginary square. The smoke stopped pouring and began to thicken. Then it solidified and small blue words started to appear on the thin slab of smoke. Bridge slid his finger over a few words, getting more details as he read the news.

Michelangelo walked over with a freshly poured beer, sat it down on a coaster, and gave Bridge a smile, "What's new in the land of fog?"

"Not much." Bridge took a sip of his beer. "It's feeling more and more empty down at the shore, although I only saw a few more lamps not being lit tonight. So while more people are moving up the Stacks, I guess most of the people who still worry about the travelers in the fog are alive and well."

"I haven't made a trip down to Sal's or Micah's in months. So much of my stuff comes in from trade through my regular Stack customers these days, I don't have to think much."

"Interesting. I guess the only thing those guys make that you can't get up in the Stacks are old gas powered things that are resistant to the fog."

"Yup." Michelangelo knocked on the wooden bar twice, "and hopefully nothing breaks anytime soon. I don't do nearly enough business to replace my lamps or doors often." Bridge raised his glass to that sentiment.

Michelangelo went back to cleaning the bar and tinkering with little things here and there. He had an old cash register that he was constantly tweaking, not that many folks paid with anything but digital currency these days.

Bridge returned to scrolling through the news. His screen informed him that he had an early morning meeting up in the Stacks, so he'd have to probably travel up there tonight instead of renting out one of Michelangelo's rooms.

Bridge took his time finishing his beer, soaking in the smell of gas burning, the hint of a fresh patch of varnish on the bar and the fresh oxygen smell of filtered fog. Once he put his empty glass down, he waved away his screen and put a pile of ratty old currency on the counter. "Michelangelo, I've got to head up. I'm gonna leave this here, feel free to deduct the rest from my account." Michelangelo stuck his arm up in the air and waved in agreement while he had his head and other arm stuck in some cabinet fixing something. "You need me to send anything down?"

A muffled voice came from behind the bar, "Just some good wine if you can find it."

"Roger that good buddy. I will see you in a few weeks."

Michelangelo stuck his thumb up into the air and went back to work as Bridge walked up the steps to the left of the bar.

## Chapter 2

The stairway was lit with artificial LED light, although thankfully not blindingly bright like how many up in the Stacks liked.

Bridge climbed the three sets of stairs at a slow pace. His trips up were becoming longer and longer. How soon would it be that he went an entire year before visiting the surface of the planet that had been home to the human race for so long?

At the top of the stairs, Bridge opened a door onto the roof of Michelangelo's Hotel and Bar. The fog had long since destroyed the sign on the door that gave the place a name, but a small flame behind blue glass still flickered, marking this place as a tavern for all weary fog travelers.

A metal post with a wooden box stood alone on the roof. Bridge approached and opened it. The sound of a vacuum decompressing echoed through the silent night as a small iron cover opened up revealing a bright green button. Bridge quickly pressed the button and shut the door. As soon as the door closed, compressed air shot out the bottom of the box as it created a vacuum inside, trying to protect the rare piece of new technology that still worked on the surface.

Somewhere, up above the fog, a cargo door opened. Men watched as  a large sideways dropped through the door and then started a propeller on its roof, slowly moving through the night sky towards the fields of grey below.

## Chapter 3

After about thirty minutes, Bridge heard the whirring noise of spinning blades cutting through the thick fog and the flash of a diffused green light as the egg sat down next to the post.

A door slid open and inside the egg there were three empty benches facing away from the point of the egg. Bridge climbed in and took the middle seat. After a few minutes, the door closed and begun to slowly climb diagonally upwards through the fog. 

After another few minutes, a transparent band appeared around the egg, and Bridge could look down. He saw nothing but grey.

About ten minutes later, the egg emerged into the dark and left the fog behind.
