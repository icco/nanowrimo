Neo San Francisco, 2050

## Chapter 1

A young man stood on the beach. He slowly breathed, his breath visible in the cold as if he was smoking a cigar. The fog was everywhere, it apparently used to burn off, but now it just hung there.

The fog has tinted red as the sun slowly set. The man just sat there in silence. No one walked by, and few sounds reached his ears except for the waves pulsating on the beach. A muffled series of clicks happened behind the man. He turned to see the street lamps slowly lit by their owners as the light from the sky faded, and then continued to watch the dark waves roll in.

As the tide slowly receded, he started walking back up the street behind him. Ten cold and wet blocks later, he walked through a door under a blue tinted lamp.

Inside was a bar. A few wooden tables were scattered across the room. One was occupied with a young woman reading; Another was taken by a couple talking quietly and sipping beer. At the bar, one of the four stools was occupied by a man reading through the news and drinking a tumbler full of some dark alcohol.

The young man approached the bar and grabbed a stool. He rotated on and stared at the two unmarked taps. Then he quietly cleared his throat.

"Michelangelo? Could I have a pint of the right beer?"

Michelangelo, a middle aged man with a light brown short beard and a heavily tattooed left-arm peeked his head out from the open doorway behind the bar, "Hey-ah Bridge! Let me just finish tweaking this and I'll be with you in a sec."

Bridge smiled. "Break the security perimeter again?"

"No comment! I think I got the parameters right this time though." Michelangelo yelled as a loud thunk came from the back room.

Bridge chuckled and drew a square in the air in front of him. As he did, a little wisp of smoke poured from his coat sleeve and filed the imaginary square. The smoke stopped pouring and began to thicken. Then it solidified and small blue words started to appear on the thin slab of smoke. Bridge slid his finger over a few words, getting more details as he read the news.

Michelangelo walked over with a freshly poured beer, sat it down on a coaster, and gave Bridge a smile, "What's new in the land of fog?"

"Not much." Bridge took a sip of his beer. "It's feeling more and more empty down at the shore, although I only saw a few more lamps not being lit tonight. So while more people are moving up the Stacks, I guess most of the people who still worry about the travelers in the fog are alive and well."

"I haven't made a trip down to Sal's or Micah's in months. So much of my stuff comes in from trade through my regular Stack customers these days, I don't have to think much."

"Interesting. I guess the only thing those guys make that you can't get up in the Stacks are old gas powered things that are resistant to the fog."

"Yup." Michelangelo knocked on the wooden bar twice, "and hopefully nothing breaks anytime soon. I don't do nearly enough business to replace my lamps or doors often." Bridge raised his glass to that sentiment.

Michelangelo went back to cleaning the bar and tinkering with little things here and there. He had an old cash register that he was constantly tweaking, not that many folks paid with anything but digital currency these days.

Bridge returned to scrolling through the news. His screen informed him that he had an early morning meeting up in the Stacks, so he'd have to probably travel up there tonight instead of renting out one of Michelangelo's rooms.

Bridge took his time finishing his beer, soaking in the smell of gas burning, the hint of a fresh patch of varnish on the bar and the fresh oxygen smell of filtered fog. Once he put his empty glass down, he waved away his screen and put a pile of ratty old currency on the counter. "Michelangelo, I've got to head up. I'm gonna leave this here, feel free to deduct the rest from my account." Michelangelo stuck his arm up in the air and waved in agreement while he had his head and other arm stuck in some cabinet fixing something. "You need me to send anything down?"

A muffled voice came from behind the bar, "Just some good wine if you can find it."

"Roger that good buddy. I will see you in a few weeks."

Michelangelo stuck his thumb up into the air and went back to work as Bridge walked up the steps to the left of the bar.

## Chapter 2

The stairway was lit with artificial LED light, although thankfully not blindingly bright like how many up in the Stacks liked.
