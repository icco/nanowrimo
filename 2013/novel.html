<p>Neo San Francisco, 2050</p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>"Under the thinning fog the surf curled and creamed, almost without sound, like a thought trying to form itself on the edge of consciousness." -- Raymond Chandler, The Big Sleep </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A young man stood on the beach. As he slowly exhaled, his breath grew in the cold as if he was smoking a cigar, a light grey cloud. The fog was everywhere, rumors claimed it used to burn off, but now it just hung there. A blanket for the planet.</p>

<p>The fog tinted red as the sun slowly set. The man just sat there in silence. No one walked by, and few sounds reached his ears except for the waves slowly pulsating on the beach. A muffled series of clicks happened behind the man. He turned to see street lamps slowly lit by their owners as the light from the sky faded, and then continued to watch the dark waves roll in.</p>

<p>As the tide slowly receded, he started walking back up the street behind him. Ten cold and wet blocks later, he pushed his way through a door under a blue tinted lamp.</p>

<p>Inside was a bar. Few wooden tables were scattered across the room. One was occupied with a young woman reading; Another was taken by a couple talking quietly and sipping beer. At the bar, one of the four stools was occupied by a man reading through the news and drinking a tumbler full of some dark alcohol.</p>

<p>The young man approached the bar and grabbed a stool. He rotated on and stared at the two unmarked taps. Then he quietly cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"Michelangelo? Could I have a pint of the right beer?"</p>

<p>Michelangelo, a middle aged man with a short light brown beard and a heavily tattooed left-arm peeked his head out from the open doorway behind the bar, "Hey-ah Bridge! Let me just finish tweaking this and I'll be with you in a sec."</p>

<p>Bridge smiled. "Break the security perimeter again?"</p>

<p>"No comment! I think I got the parameters right this time though." Michelangelo yelled as a loud thunk came from the back room.</p>

<p>Bridge chuckled and drew a square in the air in front of him. As he did, a little wisp of dark grey smoke poured from his coat sleeve and filed the imaginary square. The smoke stopped pouring and began to thicken. Then it solidified and small blue words started to appear on the thin slab of smoke. Bridge slid his finger over a few words, getting more details as he read the news.</p>

<p>Michelangelo walked over with a freshly poured beer, sat it down on a coaster, and gave Bridge a smile, "What's new in the land of fog?"</p>

<p>"Not much." Bridge took a sip of his beer. "It's feeling more and more empty down at the shore, although I only saw a few more lamps not being lit tonight. So while more people are moving up the Stacks, I guess most of the people who still worry about the travelers in the fog are alive and well."</p>

<p>"I haven't made a trip down to Sal's or Micah's in months. So much of my stuff comes in from trade through my regular Stack customers these days, I don't have to think much."</p>

<p>"Interesting. I guess the only thing those guys make that you can't get up in the Stacks are old gas powered things that are resistant to the fog."</p>

<p>"Yup." Michelangelo knocked on the wooden bar twice, "and hopefully nothing breaks anytime soon. I don't do nearly enough business to replace my lamps or doors often." Bridge raised his glass to that sentiment.</p>

<p>Michelangelo went back to cleaning the bar and tinkering with little things here and there. He had an old cash register that he was constantly tweaking, not that many folks paid with anything but digital currency these days.</p>

<p>Bridge returned to scrolling through the news. His screen informed him that he had an early morning meeting up in the Stacks, so he'd have to probably travel up there tonight instead of renting out one of Michelangelo's rooms.</p>

<p>Bridge took his time finishing his beer, soaking in the smell of gas burning, the hint of a fresh patch of varnish on the bar and the fresh oxygen smell of filtered fog. Once he put his empty glass down, he waved away his screen and put a pile of ratty old currency on the counter. "Michelangelo, I've got to head up. I'm gonna leave this here, feel free to deduct the rest from my account." Michelangelo stuck his arm up in the air and waved in agreement while he had his head and other arm stuck in some cabinet fixing something. "You need me to send anything down?"</p>

<p>A muffled voice came from behind the bar, "Just some good wine if you can find it."</p>

<p>"Roger that good buddy. I will see you in a few weeks."</p>

<p>Michelangelo stuck his thumb up into the air and went back to work as Bridge walked up the steps to the left of the bar.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>"I want to eat all the neighborhoods." -- <a href="https://twitter.com/KarlTheFog/status/392804950264143872">https://twitter.com/KarlTheFog/status/392804950264143872</a></p>

<p>The stairway was lit with artificial LED light, although thankfully not blindingly bright like how many up in the Stacks liked.</p>

<p>Bridge climbed the three sets of stairs at a slow pace. His trips up were becoming longer and longer. How soon would it be that he went an entire year before visiting the surface of the planet that had been home to the human race for so long?</p>

<p>At the top of the stairs, Bridge opened a door onto the roof of Michelangelo's Hotel and Bar. The fog had long since destroyed the sign on the door that gave the place a name, but a small flame behind blue glass still flickered, marking this place as a tavern for all weary fog travelers.</p>

<p>A metal post with a wooden box stood alone on the roof. Bridge approached and opened it. The sound of a vacuum decompressing echoed through the silent night as a small iron cover opened up revealing a bright green button. Bridge quickly pressed the button and shut the door. As soon as the door closed, compressed air shot out the bottom of the box as it created a vacuum inside, trying to protect the rare piece of new technology that still worked on the surface.</p>

<p>Somewhere, up above the fog, a cargo door opened. Men watched as  a large sideways dropped through the door and then started a propeller on its roof, slowly moving through the night sky towards the fields of grey below.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>"I heard an airplane passing overhead. I wished I was on it." -- Charles Bukowski</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After about thirty minutes, Bridge heard the whirring noise of spinning blades cutting through the thick fog and the flash of a diffused green light as the egg sat down next to the post.</p>

<p>A door slid open and inside the egg there were three empty benches facing away from the point of the egg. Bridge climbed in and took the middle seat. After a few minutes, the door closed and begun to slowly climb diagonally upwards through the fog. </p>

<p>After another few minutes, a transparent band appeared around the egg, and Bridge could look down. He saw nothing but grey.</p>

<p>About ten minutes later, the egg emerged into the dark and left the fog behind.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>"Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving." -- Terry Pratchett, A Hat Full of Sky</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The stars twinkled dimly in the sky. Their brilliance subdued by the bright white lights of the floating cities. The bottom of the city he was heading for was dark grey. Lights from engineers working on the belly of the flying beast that is Neo San Francisco created a a brighter set of stars which Bridge's egg was flying towards.</p>

<p>He saw in the distance a green light, and his egg was flying towards it.</p>

<p>As the egg got closer to the surface of the underbelly of the city, Bridge saw an open set of doors with two poles descending from the opening.</p>

<p>His egg flew in between the two poles and turned off its propeller. A loud sound echoed out as the two poles grabbed the egg and started moving upwards.</p>

<p>The egg stopped moving, and the door slid open. Outside the door a clean white light shown and the buzzing of the engineering and shipping level of the city rang out.</p>

<p>Bridge tried to cover his eyes and ears as his senses were attacked.</p>

<p>As his eyes adjusted, he noticed he was faced with a woman in a uniform carrying a sheet of metal, who was flanked on both sides by soldiers with guns.</p>

<p>"Good evening sir. Identification please."</p>

<p>Bridge reached into his front pocket and pulled out his tattered passport. He handed it slowly to the woman, all the while appreciating how well the uniform fit her. She took the passport while staring into his eyes with absolutely no emotion.</p>

<p>She put the passport on her slab of metal, which then came to life. "Your name sir?"</p>

<p>"Bridge McCarthy."</p>

<p>The metal slab beeped out; signaling it agreed.</p>

<p>"Welcome back Mr. McCarthy. It seems you were gone for twenty-six days. Did you have a safe trip?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did, thank you. Could you direct me to the nearest transportation tube, I need to get home."</p>

<p>"Of course sir. Chris, please escort Mr. McCarthy to tube C1-89. Have a wonderful night sir."</p>

<p>"You as well."</p>

<p>One of the guards slung his gun over his back and led Bridge down a tunnel, across a few bridges and through a door, where a five foot wide troff lay in the ground.</p>

<p>The guard drew a little pattern on a yellow square that was inlaid on the wall. A few seconds later a two person pod slid into the tube. "Have a good night sir," said the guard as he walked out the door they had come in.</p>

<p>Bridge climbed in the pod and touched his hand to the wall of the pod. An ethereal voice quietly spoke in the pod. "Good evening Bridge. Where would you like to go?"</p>

<p>"Home please."</p>

<p>"Certainly Bridge. Shall I notify your house that you are en-route?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>His pod flew down the shoot he was in into the tunnels of the city. Quickly, yet gently, turning at every junction making way to his apartment.</p>

<p>Minutes later, Bridge exited his pod at the front door of his apartment. The door slid open as he approached, and the lights faded on. He walked to the opposite side of his apartment and looked out. His place was near the edge of the city so he could see into the distance. He saw other floating cities and their flashing beacons of light, and he saw the sea of fog, going forever in every direction.</p>

<p>He dropped his coat and the rest of his clothes on the ground as he stumbled towards his bed. He collapsed on his bed, waiting for the night and dreams to finally come and take him away from this broken world.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>"Morning is wonderful. Its only drawback is that it comes at such an inconvenient time of day." -- Glen Cook, Sweet Silver Blues</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bridge awoke to the smell of coffee and waffles. While he was sleeping, robots had picked up his mess. He rolled out of bed and pulled up a bar stool. He plopped his butt down on the chair, grabbed a waffle and drew a square in the air. As he was slowly chewing his soft fluffy bread, a smoke sweat out of the three banded tattoos on his left arm and filled the square.</p>

<p>Not too much interesting had happened in the Stacks over the last two weeks. He made a motion of turning a knob and music came on in the room. He waved the smoke away and sipped his coffee.</p>

<p>The Stacks; Neo San Francisco. Home to five million wayward souls. A floating city above the fog. From a distance, it looks like a poorly made layer cake, or a pile of books about to topple over.</p>

<p>Bridge had a nice apartment on the western edge of the city. His job as a surveyor got him a place with a gorgeous view, albeit far away from the heart of the city. Few came to visit him, but that suited him just fine. He tried to be at home as little as possible.</p>

<p>He cleaned up and got dressed. He had a feeling this meeting would get him a good gig, so he grabbed his bag of gear. A small  bag contained goggles, a few tools, some dehydrated rations and two emergency signals. The bag connected to a thick coil of sturdy carbon fiber rope. Everything seemed in good repair.</p>

<p>Bridge sighed and walked out the door. The music stopped, the lights went out, and a few robots scurried about, cleaning up any proof that someone lived there.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>"I love mankind ... it's people I can't stand!!" -- Charles M. Schulz</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Close to the center of the Stacks, about two thirds up the towers, Bridge found the office of Chuck. Bridge had never worked with Chuck before, but a friend had referred Bridge for a job, and few people did work outside of the Stacks anymore.</p>

<p>Bridge entered Chuck's office and found himself in a room with no walls. A sense of vertigo rushed over him, but he reached out and found his arm hitting a wall. He closed his eyes, whispered "clarity", and opened his eyes. A room had reappeared. Nanobots swirled over his eyes, showing what was really in the room instead of the illusion that was being projected. </p>

<p>Across the room he saw an older man sitting smugly behind a desk in a t-shirt with his arms crossed, and a well manicured man in slacks and a collared shirt sitting on the corner of the desk.</p>

<p>"I'm here for an appointment with Chuck."</p>

<p>The man at the desk shooed the well groomed man away, "I've got it from here Mitch, thanks though." The other man sighed and fizzled away. Some sort of illusion Bridge couldn't hack away? "Welcome! You must be Bridge." The man smiled and stood up. He walked through the desk towards Bridge. "That was impressive how you broke through my fog. Not too many people can do that any more."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well, working with fog is my business."</p>

<p>"That is the true true. Well, Samantha says you're good, and I need a surveyor to find me some old technology. You interested?"</p>

<p>"I could be convinced. I just finished my last job. What specifically are you looking for?"</p>
