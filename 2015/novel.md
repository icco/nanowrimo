# A Hunt

## Chapter 1

It's a tale as old as made for television movies. A young man is teleported out of a baseball game or a restaurant or takes a wrong turn in a magic shop and ends up in an alternate time and place. Papers have been written on the topic. Many psychological studies done on the men who returned after the last epidemic in the 1990s. Some came back more confident, stronger and wiser. Others came back with bad cases of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, hallucinations and schizophrenia.

The number of young men teleported from New York City alone between the summer of 1991 and the fall of 1998 is staggering. The New York Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigations  believe that ten percent of male teenagers living in the five boroughs in the nineteen nineties experienced some sort of mystical journey. Nothing was in common between all of the cases besides the abstract idea of a hero quest and the sex of the participant.
