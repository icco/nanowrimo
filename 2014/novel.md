# Another Time

Autumn has some of the worst clouds. They sit in the sky pretending to be winter clouds, overcast, but light. Unsure of themselves as they decide how the transition between Summer and Winter will appear.

Tim sits drinking reheated coffee. His thoughts of clouds distract him from the horrible coffee in his cup. He could, for instance, go make a fresh pot if his mind came back to earth, concerned about such worldly problems. But instead he continues to stare at the grey sheet of water vapor hanging high in the sky, ushering the city from the freedom of Summer into the wet darkness of Winter.

The cold Autumn breeze finally penetrates Tim's sweatshirt, and he stands, moving indoors for artificial heat. His mind slowly starts to fill with the concerns of the day. Projects to work on, people to talk to, fights to have, tasks to be delegated, reality to ignore.

Tim leaves the office. 

It begins to rain. Something inside Tim itches. The dreary monotony of his day slowly washed off as his suit slowly gets wet. Tim tends not to care about much on Tuesdays, so he decides to walk in the rain. An hour later, he is leaving wet puddles as he shuffles up the stairs towards his flat. Inside, he strips naked. A pile of wet clothes sits next to the front door.

He takes a hot shower. Standing in the steam he dons a green bathrobe. He goes to the kitchen and makes himself a chicken and grilled cheese sandwich. He opens a beer, and sits on the couch. Tim enjoys his dinner.

As he flips through the channels, he sees something out of the corner of his eye. A brief flash of light when he changes channels. Curious, Tim stares at the light and begins to try and change the channels faster.

A shape becomes apparent. A young woman.
