# Another Time

## Chapter 1

Autumn has some of the worst clouds. They sit in the sky pretending to be winter clouds, overcast, but light. Unsure of themselves as they decide how the transition between Summer and Winter will appear.

Tim sits drinking reheated coffee. His thoughts of clouds distract him from the horrible coffee in his cup. He could, for instance, go make a fresh pot if his mind came back to earth, concerned about such worldly problems. But instead he continues to stare at the grey sheet of water vapor hanging high in the sky, ushering the city from the freedom of Summer into the wet darkness of Winter.

The cold Autumn breeze finally penetrates Tim's sweatshirt, and he stands, moving indoors for artificial heat. His mind slowly starts to fill with the concerns of the day. Projects to work on, people to talk to, fights to have, tasks to be delegated, reality to ignore.

Tim works.

Tim leaves the office. 

It begins to rain. Something inside Tim itches. The dreary monotony of his day slowly washed off as his suit slowly gets wet. Tim tends not to care about much on Tuesdays, so he decides to walk in the rain. An hour later, he is leaving wet puddles as he shuffles up the stairs towards his flat. Inside, he strips naked. A pile of wet clothes sits next to the front door.

He takes a hot shower. Standing in the steam he dons a green bathrobe. He goes to the kitchen and makes himself a chicken and grilled cheese sandwich. He opens a beer, and sits on the couch. Tim enjoys his dinner.

As he flips through the channels, he sees something out of the corner of his eye. A brief flash of light when he changes channels. Curious, Tim stares at the light and begins to try and change the channels faster.

A shape becomes apparent. A young woman. Standing in jeans and a jumper. Hair tied back in a ponytail, staring through the window towards the clouds. She flickers, an apaprition, an after-image of reflected into reality.

Tim stops drops the remote in confusion. She keeps flickering, but turns towards him and smiles. Tim stammers, "Hello?"

The aparation's mouth moves, but sound eminates from the TV, "Michael, is that you?"

"Uh no, my name is Tim. Who? What? Are you?"

The light of the TV changing channels on its own surprises Tim, almost as if it's search for a channel to say the right thing at the right time. A late night showing of "Home Improvment" flies by "Tim!" a woman yells from the screen. It seems like each channel produces one word as they TV changes quickly. "I", her mouth moving faster than the TV can change. "Am lost. My name is Michelle, and an explosion happened, and now I think I'm stuck in the internet? Or maybe the electrical wires." She seems sad. "You're the first to notice me though! Find Michael!"

"Where is he? Who is he?"

"He's in San Francisco, I think..." she flickers out of existance, cut off from finishing her sentence.

## Chapter 2

It took decades, but San Francisco was no longer the city it was. It was a husk, burnt out buildings, surounded by broken sidewalks. Graffiti signifying old companies to have come and gone. Dead bodies on the stoops of buildings, faded away from one too many chemical get-a-ways.

Old San Franciscan Victorians burned to the ground. Large portions of downtown were underwater. Luxury high rises now occupied by schools of fish. The sunset had slid down its long hill into the ocean.

Across the bay, Oakland was a metropolis of towering warehouses. Buildings over a hundred stories tall held entire communities, with different floors connecting the city with private bridges between buildings.

Cristine stands by the window sipping a glass of white wine. Her slinky black dress and high heels offset by the rifle and sword slung across her back. She peered out examing the broken bridge and the sliver of fog that was once the great city by the bay. A bright light blue and then orange light flashes, coloring the fog. Causing it to glow internally briefly.

She glances back at the party, no one seems alarmed. She hears a little voice in her ear, "Large data spike over in the city. Local network seems to be struggling, but it's not targeted at us." She nods, and taps her thumb to the pads of her fingers as if she was playing the piano. A few lights dance across her vision as she sends the last five minutes of what she saw to her partner many towers away.

## Chapter 3

A young man sits crouched over a table. The table is surrounded by random chairs, pilfered from old companies and from the side of the street. The room is sparse, this large table and its twelve chairs, a rack of computers in the corner, two large windows, a matress in the corner with a pile of sheets in the middle, and some shelves with a smattering of tools, electronics and books scattered across them.

On the table a camping stove, an empty pot, a small single tap jockey box and three unoped cans of chilli.

The man stares intently at nothing, with slight twitches of his fingers being the only sign of movement.

In his mind though, the room is alight with screens. Some describing every single movement and word being said in the room Cristine is gaurding. Others, random things throughout the net. Some describe side projects where he is breaking into digital places, and others describing the defensive battles they are currently playing.
