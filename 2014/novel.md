# Another Time

Autumn has some of the worst clouds. They sit in the sky pretending to be winter clouds, overcast, but light. Unsure of themselves as they decide how the transition between Summer and Winter will appear.

Tim sits drinking reheated coffee. His thoughts of clouds distract him from the horrible coffee in his cup. He could, for instance, go make a fresh pot if his mind came back to earth, concerned about such wordly problems. But instead he continues to stare at the grey sheet of water vapor hanging high in the sky, ushering the city from the freedom of Summer into the wet darkness of Winter.
